<h1>Friends are more influential than family.</h1>

<p>		Many people say that teenagers these days are closer to their friends than they are to their families.<br>
	In my opinion friends are more influential in their life than their families.<br>
<br>
		More and more teenagers are seeking help and understanding from their friends rather than their parents. <br>
	I believe the biggest cause for that is the generation gap. It’s easier for them to understand each other because they grew up in similar environments.<br>
	Additionally, since friends go through similar experiences they can relate to each other more, than they can with<br>
	parents or other family members.<br>
	<br>
		On the other hand, we know our families ever since we are born, so often they know stuff about us, which <br>
	our friends don’t know. That means that sometimes they can provide more personalised advice. <br>
<br>
		In conclusion, the generation gap and similar experiences lead to better connections with our friends, but <br>
	sometimes its good to ask our family for advice. Nevertheless I still believe friends have more influence on our lives.</p>
